## 1. Introduction

This repository is showcasing my journey and solutions through a series of hands-on SQL challenges. Each challenge is designed to highlight my ability to apply fundamental and advanced SQL concepts to real-world data problems. Explore the solutions to see how I leverage SQL to query, manipulate, and analyze data effectively, demonstrating my practical skills in database interaction and problem-solving.

## 2. Features

- Demonstrated SQL Proficiency: Each challenge solution clearly illustrates my understanding and application of specific SQL concepts.
- Structured Skill Showcase: Organized by key SQL topics, making it easy to navigate and assess particular areas of expertise.
- Practical Problem-Solving: Solutions to real-world data scenarios, reflecting my ability to translate requirements into efficient SQL queries.
- Comprehensive Concept Coverage: From basic SELECT statements to complex JOINs and Subqueries, a wide range of SQL skills are demonstrated.

## 3. Getting Started

This section guides you on how to set up your environment to review the SQL challenge solutions on your local machine.

### 3.1. Prerequisites

To execute and verify the SQL files used in these challenges, you will need to have MySQL installed on your system.

- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) (>= Version 8.0.41)

### 3.2. Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and access the challenge solutions-

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Cebulva/sql_practicing.git

# Navigate into the cloned repository directory
cd sql_practicing

# Navigate into the Challenges directory where the SQL files are located
cd Challenges
```
### 4. Usage

Once you have MySQL installed and have navigated to the sql_practicing repository directory (from the Installation steps), you can proceed to set up the database and run the challenge solutions.

4.1. Database Setup
First, you need to load the sample database required for the challenges.
```bash
# 1. Log in to your MySQL server (you might need to specify host, port, and password)
mysql -u your_username -p

# 2. Inside the MySQL client, create a new database for the challenges
#    You can name it 'publications_db' or anything you prefer.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS publications_db;

# 3. Select the newly created database
USE publications_db;

# 4. Load the database dump.
#    Ensure you run this command from the root of your cloned repository (e.g., 'sql_practicing/'),
#    as the 'publications_dump.sql' file is located in the 'Data/' folder relative to the root.
SOURCE Data/publications_dump.sql;

# You can now exit the MySQL client if you wish
# exit;
```
4.2. Running Challenges
After the database is set up, you can execute the SQL files for each challenge.

```bash
# 1. Navigate into the 'Challenges' directory from your repository's root
cd Challenges/

# 2. Log back into your MySQL client (if you exited)
mysql -u your_username -p

# 3. Select the database you created earlier (e.g., 'publications_db')
USE publications_db;

# 4. To execute a specific challenge file, use the SOURCE command.
#    Replace 'sql_challenges_1.sql' with the actual file name of the challenge you want to run.
SOURCE 'sql_challenges_1.sql';

# Example: To run the second challenge
# SOURCE 'sql_challenges_2.sql';
```

### 5. Demonstrated SQL Skills

The Challenges directory contains structured SQL files, each focusing on a specific set of concepts. Click on any challenge below to see a brief description and a direct link to its solution file.

<details>
<summary>Challenge 1: SELECT, FROM, AS, and DISTINCT</summary>
<br>
This challenge focuses on the foundational SQL commands for basic data retrieval. It demonstrates how to select specific columns, define the source table, alias columns for readability, and retrieve unique values.

<details>
<summary>Challenge 2: WHERE, AND, OR, and NOT</summary>
<br>
This section explores conditional data filtering using the `WHERE` clause combined with logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to narrow down results based on specific criteria.

<details>
<summary>Challenge 3: ORDER BY and LIMIT & Aggregations â€“ COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, and AVG</summary>
<br>
This challenge demonstrates how to sort query results using `ORDER BY`, restrict the number of rows with `LIMIT`, and perform powerful data summarization using aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG`.

<details>
<summary>Challenge 4: LIKE, IN, and BETWEEN</summary>
<br>
Here, I showcase the use of `LIKE` for pattern matching, `IN` for matching against a list of values, and `BETWEEN` for checking if values fall within a specified range.

<summary>Challenge 5 & Bonus 1: GROUP BY and HAVING</summary>
<br>
This section delves into grouping rows that have the same values into summary rows using `GROUP BY`, and then filtering those groups with the `HAVING` clause.
